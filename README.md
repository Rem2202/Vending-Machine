The Vending Machine Project consists of two product dispensing units controlled by two stepper motors, two Arduino boards, an LCD, two product selection buttons, and a coin detector.
For the dispensing system, two manually crafted metal wire springs are utilized, attached to the two stepper motors.
The coin detector is composed of a 3D-printed body housing two infrared sensors that detect coins as they pass
in front of them, simultaneously adding them to the entered sum. Additionally, the coin detector features two
servomotors used for providing change.
The LCD is employed to display the entered sum. All project components are connected to two Arduino boards:
the first manages the coin detection system, LCD, and buttons, while the second is responsible for controlling the
servomotors.
